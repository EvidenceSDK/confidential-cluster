# Trusted Cluster enhanced by CC API & CCNP

## 1. Definitions

**Confidential Cluster** is defined by:

- [Redhat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/confidential-computing-use-cases): A confidential cluster (CCl) is a cluster of confidential virtual machines, which are considered to be part of a single trust domain
- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/confidential-gke-nodes): Confidential GKE Nodes is built on top of Compute Engine Confidential VM, which encrypts the memory contents of VMs in-use. Confidential GKE Nodes can be enabled as a cluster-level security setting or a node pool-level security setting.
- [Edgeless](https://www.edgeless.systems/products/constellation/): Leverages confidential computing to isolate entire Kubernetes clusters from the infrastructure.

**Trusted Cluster** is End-to-End measurement for Confidential Cluster:

In above diagram:

- **CIMA (Container Integrity Measurement Agent)** is used to calculate the measurement for node, namespace,
POD and cluster level.
- **Evidence API** provides unified API to tenant to access measurement, event log
and quote (report).

## 3. Deployment

There are 3 options creating a confidential cluster.

- Create a few confidential VMs (CVMs) and deploy Kubernetes within them. The CVMs can be on local hosts if you have supported hardware. The CVMs can also be applied from CSP.
The document [csp_cvm.md](./deployment/csp_cvm.md) shows how to apply for a TD on Google Cloud or Azure and start a Kubernetes cluster in the single confidential node.
- Create [Confidential GKE node](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/announcing-general-availability-of-confidential-gke-nodes) on Google cloud.
- Create a Constellation based confidential cluster on top of a TDX machine. Follow the steps [here](./deployment/Constellation/constellation.md) to deploy the cluster.
